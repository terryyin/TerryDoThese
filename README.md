TerryDoThese
============

A small command line TODO tool for myself and tailored for my own needs. But you can of cause use it for your own good as well. 

## Developement status
This idea just begins and I will do it manually for a while to see what do I need.

## Wishlist
[ ] Add an item from any where
[ ] Display the items
[ ] Cannot add more than 5 items
[ ] Mark one item as done
[ ] Commit the list to github (in my case, a private repository)
